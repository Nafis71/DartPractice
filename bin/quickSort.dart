  It is one of the most widely used sorting algorithm
  It follows divide and conquer paradigm.
  Recursion is used in quicksort implementation.
  In each recursive call, a pivot is chosen then the array is partitioned in such a way
  that all the elements less than pivot is lie to the left and all the elements greater
  than pivot lie to the right
  After every call, the chosen pivot occupies its correct position in the array which it is
  supposed to as in sorted array
  So with each step, problem gets reduced by 2 which leads to quick sorting
  Pivot can be last element of current array, first element of current array, or
  any random element.
